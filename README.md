# Trolley Pickle

## About The Project

### Description
The game takes place in a 3D game environment where the player begins in a trolley 
racing down the tracks through a hilly terrain. Prior to starting, players must choose from a 
dropdown menu one of three ethical frameworks: Deontology, Utilitarianism, or Ethics of 
Care. This selection determines the lines of dialogue presented by a non-playable character 
named The Conductor. The Conductor claims to have kidnapped the player’s character to test 
their moral compass.  

The Conductor challenges the player’s moral principles by presenting a series of 
dilemmas, stating the trolley is on track to run over a group of innocent people. Players may 
choose to divert the trolley onto an alternate track, which also has individuals at risk. 
Player decisions affect the dialogue provided by The Conductor, either congratulating 
or criticizing their choices depending on whether the choice is supported by the chosen 
framework or not.  

There is a total of ten dilemmas presented in sequence, each designed to challenge the 
player’s ethical reasoning. At the end of the game, the player is presented with feedback on 
how many decisions were aligned with the chosen framework and how many decisions 
aligned with the other frameworks.
