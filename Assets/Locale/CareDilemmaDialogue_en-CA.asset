    m_Localized: 'I will admit, this is a difficult framework to apply in this scenario,
      but I agree that this is the most valid choice. '
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 17235602038784
    m_Localized: "You have no relationships with any of the individuals, and there
      are no special needs or vulnerabilities, and empathy doesn\u2019t lead one
      way or another."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 17255147495424
    m_Localized: Instead, you could think about how you would be personally affected
      if you pulled the lever. You would be personally sacrificing one person, which
      may violate your need for self-care above all, since you can only care for
      others after you care for yourself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1745522355331072
    m_Localized: "I\u2019ll admit, ethics of care is a difficult framework to apply
      to this scenario, but I would say it\u2019s best to not sacrifice the one."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1745620162306048
    m_Localized: Think about this, you are actively diverting the track to sacrifice
      the one person to save five. How will the burden of actively killing someone
      affect your own self-care? How will that psychologically and emotionally affect
      you?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1745822893989888
    m_Localized: "Once again a difficult situation to apply this framework to, but
      like last time the correct answer is to think about yourself and your self-care.
      Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll mix things up for the next one."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1745919123906560
    m_Localized: "This dilemma is very similar to the last, therefore the reasoning
      should be the same. Think about your own self care in these simple situations.
      Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re going to mix things up in the next dilemma, so
      ethics of care is better utilized.\u2003"

    m_Localized: "You\u2019ve identified that the baby is far more vulnerable than
      the adults. The baby is totally dependant and in the greatest need of protection.
      Not to mention empathizing would also favor the baby. The baby requires the
      most care, and it would take a toll on you if you didn\u2019t help it."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1746387589914624
    m_Localized: This one is a tricky one, but I would say it would be best to sacrifice
      the five adults to save the baby. The baby is a fully dependent person that
      is in the greatest need of protection.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: "Despite the fact that the baby may grow up and cause a genocide,
      it\u2019s still a helpless, fully dependent, vulnerable baby that requires
      the most care. "

    m_Localized: "It\u2019s a baby. A baby that\u2019s fully dependent, helpless,
      and vulnerable."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1746628548485120
    m_Localized: Therefore, sacrificing a baby to save ten people is not providing
      the most care in this situation.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1746717534838784
    m_Localized: This is probably the most clear-cut decision yet!

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1746790511534080
    m_Localized: Out of all the dilemmas, this should have been the easiest for ethics
      of care; there is an actual relationship going on here!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1746822937698304
    m_Localized: You have a long-standing relationship with your friend. Ethics of
      care focuses on relationships, empathy, and responsibility. You should have
      saved your friend.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Therefore, the best way to handle this scenario with care is to
      maintain your moral integrity and save your enemy.

    m_Localized: "You let your emotions get to you, didn\u2019t you? I know ethics
      of care focuses on relationships, but just because you have a bad relationship
      doesn\u2019t mean you kill them."

      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: You made the difficult decision, identifying the children are more
      vulnerable than you, that they have a greater need than you.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1747323720818688
    m_Localized: "They can\u2019t understand the danger, nor act or protect themselves.
      Therefore, the caring act was to sacrifice yourself instead."
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: "While it is true that you should care for yourself, you failed
      to identify that the five children are more vulnerable than you. The children
      can\u2019t understand the danger, act for themselves, or even protect themselves."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1747663157452800
    m_Localized: You sacrificing them compromises your morals, your caring identity
